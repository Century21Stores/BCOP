Century 21 Department Stores LLC (and its affiliates, as applicable, “Century 21”) reserves the right to substitute a reward of equal or greater value and to void CENTURYCASH in Century 21’s discretion, including in the event the Eligible Purchase (either used to earn the applicable CENTURYCASH or redeem the applicable CENTURYCASH) is canceled or returned. Employees of Century 21 may participate in this CENTURYCASH promotion.</p>

<p><b>2. Eligibility: Void where prohibited, taxed or restricted by law.</b><p>


<h3>3. How to Redeem CENTURYCASH</h3>
