	<h1>Price Matching Policy</h1>

		<div>
				<p>If you find a lower advertised price within 14 days of your purchase IN-STORE or ONLINE, 
				at a qualifying U.S.-based competitor for any item that Century 21 Department Store has in stock, we’ll gladly match their price.</p>
		
				<p>Century 21 Department Store reserves the right to LIMIT the price match quantity to <b>3</b> of the identical items. The advertised item, 
				which can be at a competitor’s regular or promotional price, must be identical to the Century 21 Department Store item and be available for sale at the time of the price match. 
				EXCLUSIONS APPLY: COSMETICS, ELECTRONICS, FINE JEWELRY and LEASED BUSINESSES.</p> 
		
				<p>To request an IN-STORE price match within 14 days from original purchase date, please present proof of lower price to your cashier. 
				Acceptable proof must be in the form of a local competitor’s advertisement: the ITEM must be available IN-STORE at the local competitor. 
				Photographs will only be accepted if they include a picture of the ITEM—showing both the SIZE tag and the PRICE tag. </p>

				<p>To request an ONLINE price match within 14 days of your delivery date, you must <a href="tel:+1-877-350-2121">contact Customer Service</a> and provide proof of competitor pricing as outlined below:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Provide the Customer Service agent with a link to the competitor’s website that the agent can view to verify pricing. </li>
						<li>If you have already purchased the item from Century 21 and find it at a competitor, simply call or email us within 14 days and we will gladly adjust the price. The price must be able to be verified on the competitor’s site. Credit will be provided to the original form of payment or store credit.</li>
					</ul>
		
				<p>We are unable to match prices from select ONLINE retailers. Century 21 will not match prices from AMAZON, OUTLET sites, ONLINE marketplace sites, DEAL sites and internationally based stores and websites.</p>

				<p>Other retailers’ promotional offers/coupons, shipping promotions and gift card offers are also not eligible for the Century 21 price match. </p>

				<p>Century 21 Department Store reserves the right to limit quantities on price match items.</p>

				<p>Century 21 Department Store reserves the right to determine, in its discretion, local competitors and identical items.</p>
