	<p><b>Please note</b> that some items cannot be shipped to international addresses and are not eligible for MyUS.com's services.
	These restrictions include such items as pressurized cans (e.g. aerosol cans), and hazardous materials (e.g. nail polish). 
	Additional restrictions may apply to your destination; the MyUs.com website has a complete list of prohibited items for different countries.</p>

	<p>The unauthorized reselling or distribution of Century21 Department Store (C21Stores.com) products is prohibited. 
	Orders placed with the intention of exchanging money for product, are against Century 21 Department Store’s company policy and we have alerts in our system setup to identify such orders. 
	C21Stores.com reserves the right to cancel any order, without prior notification to the customer. Obtaining a MyUS membership does not bypass this company policy. 
	If you would like clarification on whether your order is considered “reselling”, please contact our Customer Service Department.</p>  

	<p>For all Customer Service inquires, order placement information, and orders call 877-350-2121.</p>  

	<p>If you choose to use MyUS to forward your order outside of the <b>continental United States, Alaska, or Hawaii,</b> then we consider their U.S. address to be the destination for your order. 
	Once our order safely reaches MyUS.com warehouses in the USA, they take responsibility for loss or damage to your order when shipping it internationally. 
	We recommend that you review their insurance options for international shipments before you place your order.</p>
