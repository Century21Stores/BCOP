<h3>SHIPPING METHODS</h3>

<strong>WHAT SHIPPING METHODS DO YOU USE?</strong>
<p>We have relationships with a number of carriers, so how your package ships depends upon the address and destination.

The carrier details and tracking number will be included in your Ship Confirmation email and also be posted in the &quot;My Account&quot; section when you are logged into the C21Stores.com website. <b>Please note that all orders $500 and over require signature confirmation upon delivery.</b></p>

<!-- QUESTION 3.2 -->
<strong>CAN I SHIP TO MULTIPLE SHIPPING ADDRESSES WITHIN ONE ORDER?</strong>
<p>Each order can only be shipped to one address at this time. If you wish to deliver to multiple addresses, please submit a separate order for each address.</p>

<p>The unauthorized reselling or distribution of Century 21 Department Store (C21Stores.com) products is prohibited.

<p>If you choose to use MyUs to forward your order outside of the <b>continental United States, Alaska, or Hawaii,</b> then we consider their U.S. address to be the destination for your order. Once our order safely reaches MyUs.com warehouses in the USA, they take responsibility for loss or damage to your order when shipping it internationally. We recommend that you review their insurance options for international shipments before you place your order.</p>
