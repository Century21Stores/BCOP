      <p>To Our Valued Customers,</p>
      <p>Please note that effective March 18, 2020, as a result of the various Municipal and State orders, all Century 21 stores are required to close until further notice.</p>
      <p>As you may know, Century 21 Stores is a family-run business that was founded over 60 years ago in New York City. Since then, we have only closed our landmark store on Cortlandt Street once – after the devastation of 9/11. But, like the New Yorkers we are, we persevered and were one of the first to reopen many months later. </p>
      <p>As we watch the world unite with that same perseverance today, we are hopeful that these necessary precautions will help us all weather this storm together. </p>
      <p>We thank you for being a loyal customer and invite you to continue to shop C21stores.com for the time being. Just like our brick and mortar stores, the online shop is updated with new deals each week – with prices up to 65% off every day – as only Century 21 Stores can deliver.</p>
      <p>We will continue to closely monitor the situation and follow the guidance of government and health experts, to determine when we can safely reopen our stores.
      </p>
      <p>Stay Well,</p>
      <p>The Gindi Family</p>
